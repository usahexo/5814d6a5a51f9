#  Bingo in North Dakota: When Does It End?

Bingo is a popular game in North Dakota, and people from all over the state come together to play. There are many different variants of the game, and everyone seems to have their own opinion on when the game should end. In this article, we'll take a look at some of the different opinions on bingo and when it should end.

Most people seem to agree that bingo should last for a certain amount of time - usually around two or three hours. After that, the game is usually considered over. Some people believe that bingo should last for a specific number of rounds, while others believe that it should continue until one player has won all of the cards.

There are also some people who believe that bingo shouldn't have any set ending point. They believe that the game should continue until one player has run out of cards or money. This can be a bit risky, as it can lead to fights and disagreements among players.

Ultimately, it's up to the individual players to decide when bingo should end. If there is a disagreement among players about when the game should end, then the decision can be made by flipping a coin or drawing straws. Whoever wins the coin flip or gets the shortest straw gets to decide when bingo ends.
