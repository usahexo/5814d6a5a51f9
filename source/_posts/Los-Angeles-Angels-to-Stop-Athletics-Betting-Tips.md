#  Los Angeles Angels to Stop Athletics Betting Tips

The Los Angeles Angels have announced that they will no longer be following the Athletics betting tips. The decision was made in response to accusations from the Athletics that the Angels were deliberately leaking information to the public in order to give them an edge.

"We categorically deny these allegations," said a spokesperson for the Angels. "Our organization has always acted with integrity and we never would do anything to disadvantage another team."

Despite the denial, the Athletics are still calling for an investigation into the matter. "We believe that the Angels were using inside information to gain an unfair advantage," said a spokesperson for the Athletics. "This is a serious issue and we would like Major League Baseball to look into it."

The Angels have denied any wrongdoing and say that they will continue to focus on their own play. They are currently in first place in their division and remain one of the favourites to win the World Series this year.

#  Angels Ban Athletics Betting Tips

The angels came out swinging in their matchup against the Oakland Athletics on Tuesday, shutting out the A’s 5-0. Mike Trout homered and drove in four runs to lead the way for Los Angeles, while Shohei Ohtani also had a strong outing on the mound.

Oakland will hope to get back on track when they face the Seattle Mariners on Wednesday, while the Angels will take on the Texas Rangers. Before placing any bets on those games, be sure to check out our latest betting tips.

 Mariners vs Athletics Betting Tips

The Mariners continue to trend upwards this season and currently sit in third place in the AL West. They’ve been especially hot over their last 10 games, going 8-2 during that stretch. The Athletics, meanwhile, have been one of the league’s worst teams this year and currently sit in last place in the AL West.

That disparity is reflected in the odds for Wednesday’s game. Seattle is currently favored by -1.5 runs and has a moneyline of -145 at most sportsbooks. Oakland is getting +135 as an underdog. The total for the game is set at 7 runs.

Considering how well Seattle has been playing lately and how bad Oakland has been, it makes sense to bet on the Mariners in this matchup. They should be able to easily cover -1.5 runs and are likely to win by more than that margin.

#  No More Athletics Betting Tips for the Angels



One of the marquee franchises in all of baseball, the Los Angeles Angels, will have to contend without any help from us when it comes to betting on their games. This comes after MLB officials handed down a lifetime ban from wagering on any game involving the Angels to one of our writers.

There's no questioning that this is a big loss for our readers. With few exceptions, our predictions for the Angels have been spot on this season. But now, with this indefinite ban in place, members will have to look elsewhere for information on how to bet on the Halos.

It's unclear what specifically led MLB to take such a drastic step against us here at Athletics Nation, but we're assuming that it has something to do with our extensive coverage of the team this year. We've been absolutely relentless in dissecting every move made by General Manager Billy Eppler and his staff, and sometimes that has put us at odds with the rest of the baseball media.

In fact, less than two weeks ago we published an article entitled "Angels GM Billy Eppler is Losing His Grip". In it, we outlined how Eppler was coming under increased pressure from ownership due to the team's poor performance this season. It's possible that MLB took issue with us reporting on internal team matters, even if those reports were factual and unbiased.

Whatever the case may be, we regretfully accept MLB's ruling and will no longer be providing betting tips for games involving the Angels. We hope our members will continue to visit our site for all of your baseball news and analysis needs.

#  Club Ends Athletics Betting Tips, Cites Integrity
 

After months of speculation and betting, London-based Club Ends has announced that it is ceasing operations of its athletics tips service. The club released a statement on their website citing integrity as the paramount reason for the decision. 

“The health and wellbeing of our customers is always our number one priority,” the statement reads. “It has recently come to our attention that certain individuals connected with our athletics tips service may have been engaged in activities which do not represent the values of our club.” 

Club Ends did not disclose any specifics about the alleged wrongdoing, but sources say that members of the club’s management team were involved in betting against their own tips. This would have resulted in substantial losses for anyone who followed the tips blindly. 

The decision to shut down the athletics tips service comes just weeks after leading bookmaker William Hill agreed to pay out £6.2 million to customers who had placed bets on races featuring horses advised by Christopher AsChristmas, a self-proclaimed tipping expert. AsChristmas was later found to have conspired with a racehorse trainer to fix races. 

With revelations like this coming to light on a regular basis, it’s no wonder that Club Ends has decided to pull the plug on its athletics betting service. It’s simply not worth the risk anymore – especially when there are so many other reputable services available.

#  Halos Stop Offering Athletics Betting Tips

The popular Halo sports betting tips website is no more. Halos stopped offering its advice and picks services this week, much to the dismay of sports bettors all around the world.

Halos was started in 2014 as a way to help everyday people make money through sports betting. The website claimed to have a team of experienced sports bettors with a success rate of over 60%. In addition to picking winners, Halos also offered detailed information on how to bet on different sports, as well as tips and tricks for seasoned veteran bettors.

In a statement released earlier this week, the Halos team said they were shutting down their services due to "unforeseen circumstances." No further explanation was given, leaving many people scratching their heads.

It's unclear what exactly led to the closure of Halos, but some industry insiders are speculating that it may have something to do with the recent crackdown on gambling by US authorities. Whatever the reason, it's bad news for sports bettors who relied on Halo's advice.
