#  Could Danmachi Memoria Freese Actually Mean the End for the Series?

Danmachi Memoria Freese, the new mobile game for the popular Danmachi (or Is It Wrong to Try to Pick Up Girls in a Dungeon?) series, is raising eyebrows among fans. While the game does look quite promising, with gorgeous graphics and an interesting story, some are worried that it might be a sign that the end is nigh for the franchise. Let's take a look at the evidence and see if there's any truth to this theory.

First off, it's worth noting that Danmachi Memoria Freese is not your average mobile game. It's not just a reskinned version of an existing game or a light novel adaptation – it's actually a brand new story set in the world of Danmachi. This suggests that the developers have big plans for the game and they're not just releasing it as an excuse to milk more money from fans.

In addition, there have already been hints that Danmachi Memoria Freese might serve as a prequel to the original light novel series. For example, one of the main characters in the game is Aiz Wallenstein – who doesn't appear in the original light novel until Volume 4. This suggests that her backstory will be explored in greater detail in Danmachi Memoria Freese.

So what does all this mean for the future of Danmachi? It's hard to say for sure, but it certainly seems like there's more story to tell in this world and Danmachi Memoria Freese could very well be laying the groundwork for bigger things to come. The optimist in me hopes that this will lead to more anime episodes or even another light novel series – but I suppose we'll just have to wait and see.

Coming off the success of the first two seasons of the Danmachi anime, fans of the series have been eagerly awaiting information on the upcoming Memoria Freese smartphone game. Earlier this week, a website for the game was launched, and while it doesn't offer too many details, it does give us a few more hints about what to expect.

For starters, we now know that the game will be set in the same world as the anime, and will feature a story written by series creator Fujino Ōmori. The key visual on the website also features Bell Cranel and Aiz Wallenstein in their familiar adventurers' clothes.

We also get our first glimpse at some of the game's characters, including Hermes (voiced by Daisuke Ono), who appears to be an antagonist, and Mikoto (voiced by Risa Taneda), who is said to be a childhood friend of Bell's.
