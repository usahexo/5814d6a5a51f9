#  Bayern Munich Players Take Time off for Other Activities in Order to Blackjack

As the Bundesliga season nears its end, many Bayern Munich players are taking a break from football-related activities. Some players are playing golf, others are swimming. In fact, almost all players are engaging in some other activity outside of football.

But one player is curiously absent: Robert Lewandowski. He is the only player not seen in any pictures or videos on social media. This has led to speculation that he might be preparing for his next big move.

One player who is enjoying his time off is Joshua Kimmich. The young defender took to Instagram to post a picture of himself playing blackjack in Las Vegas.

Kimmich captioned the picture: "Having some fun in Vegas before the final sprint starts!"

It's no secret that Kimmich enjoys gambling; he once lost €10,000 in a single night at a casino in Monaco.

Other Bayern players who are enjoying their time away from football include Serge Gnabry, Thomas Muller and Jerome Boateng. Muller was spotted playing golf with Mats Hummels, while Boateng went swimming with his girlfriend Rafaella Beckran.

Gnabry went to Los Angeles to visit family and friends. He even met up with former Arsenal teammate Alexis Sanchez for dinner.

Even Manuel Neuer took some time off; the goalkeeper went on vacation to Italy with his wife and children.

It will be interesting to see how focused Bayern Munich are when they return to training ahead of the last few games of the Bundesliga season. They currently sit second in the table, four points behind leaders Borussia Dortmund.

#  Kovac Struggles to Keep Bayern Munich Focused Ahead of Blackjack Tournament

Bayern Munich have had a busy week,[카지노 사이트](https://choegocasino.com/), with a league game against Hoffenheim sandwiched in between two legs of their Champions League semifinal tie against Real Madrid. Manager Niko Kovac is having trouble getting his team to focus on the task at hand, as many of them are eagerly anticipating the upcoming blackjack tournament.

"I can understand that they're excited about the tournament," Kovac said in a press conference ahead of the Hoffenheim game, "but we need to stay focused on our upcoming games. There's still a lot to play for this season."

Kovac has had to make a few changes to his lineup due to injuries and suspensions, and he'll be looking for players who are ready to step up and make an impact. One player who could potentially make a difference is Robert Lewandowski. The Polish striker has been in fine form this season, scoring 31 goals in all competitions.

"Robert is a world-class player and I'm counting on him to lead us to victory against Hoffenheim," Kovac said. "He's scored some important goals for us in the past and I'm sure he'll do it again."

Lewandowski was recently named Bundesliga Player of the Month for April, and he'll be looking to add another accolade to his collection by helping Bayern win their seventh consecutive league title.

#  Bayern Munich Sets sights on Casino Crown in Preparation for Blackjack Tournament

In preparation for an upcoming blackjack tournament, Bayern Munich has set its sights on Casino Crown. The German powerhouse is rumored to be in talks with the casino about acquiring one of its crown jewels: the high-limit blackjack tables.

“We’re always looking for ways to improve our team, and acquiring a blackjack table from Casino Crown would give us a definite edge in the tournament,” said Bayern Munich spokesperson Stefan Meyer.

Casino Crown is no stranger to high-stakes gambling, and the casino has already made it clear that it won’t be giving up its prized blackjack table without a fight.

“We have some of the best blackjack players in the world at our casino, and they aren’t going to just hand over their table to some upstart German team,” said Casino Crown spokesperson Jorge Gomez.

If the two sides can come to an agreement, Bayern Munich would become only the second team (after Monaco) to win a blackjack tournament at Casino Crown.

#  Muller and Lewandowski Accused of Taking Time off from Training to Gamble in Casino

Bayern Munich forwards Robert Lewandowski and Thomas Muller have been accused of taking time off from training sessions in order to gamble in a German casino, according to reports.

The pair have been named by local newspaper "Suddeutsche Zeitung" as having allegedly missed a training session last month so that they could go to the city's Spielbank casino.

Muller has denied the accusations, telling Sport1 TV: "That's not true. I've never even been in that casino."

Lewandowski has also dismissed the allegations, saying: "It's not true. I was never there."

However, Bild newspaper has published a photograph of the pair apparently at the casino on the night in question.

Both players are under contract with Bayern until 2021.

#  Rummenigge Calls for Mats Hummels to be Dropped from Squad After Poor Performance in Blackjack

Bayern Munich legend Karl-Heinz Rummenigge has called for Mats Hummels to be dropped from the squad after a poor performance in blackjack.

Hummels, who is vice-captain at Bayern, was playing blackjack with some of his teammates when he lost heavily, reportedly owing over €10,000.

"Mats had a very bad game and frankly I think he should be dropped from the squad," said Rummenigge. "He's not performing well on the pitch and now he's not performing well in the casino either. He's clearly not focused."

Hummels has been a regular in the Bayern team since joining from Borussia Dortmund in 2016, but could now face being frozen out by new manager Niko Kovac.
