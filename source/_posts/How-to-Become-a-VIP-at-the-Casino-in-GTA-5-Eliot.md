# Precisely How to Maximize Your Rewards as a VIP at the Casino in GTA 5 Eliot

The thrill and excitement of gambling at a casino is something that can be enjoyed by many. However, if you really want to make the most of your experience and maximize your rewards, then you need to become a VIP.

In Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA 5), there are three different VIP levels that players can achieve, which offer different benefits depending on the level. To become a VIP, you first need to reach rank 100 in the game’s multiplayer mode called “GTA Online”.

Once you have reached rank 100, you will then be able to purchase the “VIP” upgrade from any Ammu-Nation store for $2,750,000. This will give you access to the VIP lobby where you can start working your way up the VIP levels.

The first step is to achieve level 1 and this can be done by earning 10,000 Reputation Points (RP). Once you have achieved level 1, you will unlock new benefits such as increased weapon ammo and armor, as well as doubled rewards from all jobs and challenges.

To progress to level 2, you will need to earn another 20,000 RP. This will give you access to even more benefits such as a temporary increase in health and armor, and the ability to call in a helicopter or plane for a quick getaway.

The final step is to achieve level 3 and this can be done by earning 50,000 RP. This will give you access to even more benefits such as free car repairs and explosives, as well as triple rewards from all jobs and challenges.

So if you want to make the most of your time at the casino in GTA 5, then make sure you become a VIP!

3. Play more often

Finally, one of the best ways to progress up the ranks at the casino is simply by playing more often. The more games you play, the more chances you have of winning – and as a VIP player, you get access to better bonuses and rewards as well. So make sure to play as often as possible and rack up those wins!
