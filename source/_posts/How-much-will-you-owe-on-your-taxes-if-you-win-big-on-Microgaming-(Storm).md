#  Can I claim my Microgaming (Storm) gambling losses on my taxes?

The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) allows taxpayers to claim gambling losses on their tax returns. This is a great way to help reduce the amount of taxable income that you have. However, there are some rules that you need to follow in order to be able to claim your gambling losses.

The first thing that you need to do is make sure that you keep track of your gambling losses for the year. This includes keeping track of the amount of money that you lose as well as the dates and locations of the gambling activities. You will also need to keep track of any winnings that you may have from gambling activities.

In order to be able to claim your gambling losses, you need to itemize your deductions on your tax return. This means that you cannot use the standard deduction when filing your taxes. You will also need to report the amount of your losses as income on line 21 of Form 1040.

There are some limitations to what you can claim as a gambling loss. You cannot claim any expenses that are related to your gambling activity, such as travel or food expenses. In addition, you cannot claim any losses that are more than your winnings for the year.

If you have questions about whether or not you can claim your gambling losses on your taxes, it is best to speak with a tax professional. They will be able to help guide you through the process and answer any questions that you may have.
