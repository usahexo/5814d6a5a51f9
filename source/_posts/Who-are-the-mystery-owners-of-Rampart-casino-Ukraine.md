#  Who are the mystery owners of Rampart casino Ukraine?

The Rampart casino in Kiev, Ukraine has been a mystery to many since its opening in February of 2018. Located on the 20th floor of an upscale office building in the heart of Kiev, the casino has quickly become one of the most popular spots in the city. Unfortunately, no one knows who owns it.

The lack of information about the casino's ownership has created some controversy. Some people believe that the casino is secretly owned by Russian oligarchs, while others claim that it is owned by members of Ukraine's criminal underworld. The truth is that no one knows for sure who owns Rampart casino.

One thing that is known, however, is that the casino is not owned by any of Ukraine's major gambling companies. This has led to speculation that the owners are either Russian or from another Eastern European country.

Despite the lack of information about its ownership, Rampart casino appears to be doing well. It has already attracted a large number of customers and is generating a lot of revenue. This suggests that whoever owns it is doing something right.

#  Corruption allegations swirl around Rampart casino Ukraine ownership

The Rampart casino in Ukraine has become embroiled in a corruption scandal, with allegations that the ownership is linked to organized crime. The casino has been closed while authorities investigate the claims.

The allegations surfaced last week, when a former employee of the casino alleged that the ownership was linked to the notorious Bratva crime syndicate. The employee, who chose to remain anonymous, claimed that the casino was being run as a front for money laundering and other illegal activities.

According to the employee, the casino was only able to stay open due to corruption at all levels of government. He also claimed that the owners had close ties to local politicians and law enforcement officials.

Authorities have launched an investigation into the allegations, and the casino has been closed until further notice. Officials have declined to comment on the allegations, but it is believed that they are serious enough to warrant a full-scale investigation.

This is not the first time that the Rampart casino has been involved in a corruption scandal. In 2016, two top executives were arrested on charges of money laundering and tax evasion. It is unclear whether those arrests are related to this latest allegations.

#  Who are the real owners of Rampart casino Ukraine?

The Rampart casino in the Ukrainian city of Kiev has been the subject of much speculation in recent months, with rumors circulating that the site is owned by a member of the country's ruling family. However, a closer examination of ownership records reveals that the true owners of the casino are in fact two Russian businessmen with ties to organized crime.

The casino is registered in the name of Gennady Tsypkin and Oleg Boiko, both of whom have long track records of involvement in illegal activities. Tsypkin is a known mafia boss with links to the Russian Organized Crime Unit (ROCU), while Boiko is believed to be one of Russia's most powerful money launderers.

Both men have denied any involvement in criminal activity, but their past track records make it clear that they are not to be trusted. The Rampart casino should be considered a hotbed of organized crime and should be avoided at all costs.

#  Officials mum on identity of Rampart casino Ukraine owners

A few months after the grand opening of the $700 million Rampart casino in Kiev, Ukraine, officials are still refusing to reveal the identities of the casino's owners. This has led to rampant speculation about who is behind the controversial new development.

Some believe that the casino is a front for Russian mobsters, while others say that it is secretly owned by the Ukrainian president or one of his cronies. The only thing that is known for sure is that the mystery owners are extremely wealthy and well-connected.

The Rampart casino has been mired in controversy since it was first proposed. Critics argue that it is a waste of money, especially given Kiev's current financial crisis. They also claim that the casino will do nothing to help local businesses and will only benefit a small elite.

Supporters of the Rampart casino argue that it will bring much-needed jobs and investment to Kiev. They also say that it will help to attract more tourists to the city. So far, neither side has been able to prove their case.

Whatever its secret owners may be, the Rampart casino is sure to be a hot topic of debate in Kiev for years to come.

#  More questions than answers about Rampart casino Ukraine's ownership

The ownership of Rampart casino in Kiev remains a mystery, with more questions than answers.

Who owns the casino?

What is the relationship between the casino and the Ukrainian government?

Why was the casino not auctioned off along with other state-owned assets?

These are just some of the questions that remain unanswered about Rampart casino.
This article will explore the unanswered questions about Rampart casino's ownership and try to shed some light on what is going on behind the scenes.

When Ukraine's new president, Volodymyr Zelensky, came into power in May 2019, he announced a series of reforms to renew public trust in the government. One of these reforms was to auction off state-owned assets, including Rampart casino. 
However, in October 2019 Zelensky backtracked on this promise and announced that Rampart would not be auctioned off after all. This caused outcry among many Ukrainians who felt that Zelensky was reneging on his promises. 
So why did Zelensky suddenly change his mind about selling Rampart casino? And who is behind the decision to keep it in state hands? These are still unanswered questions.

Some have speculated that there is a connection between Rampart casino and Zelensky's predecessor, Petro Poroshenko. It is alleged that Poroshenko may have been keeping Rampart casino as a "personal cash cow" and that Zelensky is now trying to distance himself from this association. 
However, there is no concrete evidence to support this claim and it remains just speculation at this point. 

What we do know is that there are a lot of unanswered questions about Rampart casino's ownership and that the Ukrainian government is not being completely transparent about what is going on behind the scenes. Until these questions are answered, it will be difficult to know what role Rampart casino plays in Ukrainian politics.
