        <h1 id="What-is-the-difference-between-computer-storage-and-memory"><a href="#What-is-the-difference-between-computer-storage-and-memory" class="headerlink" title="What is the difference between computer storage and memory?"></a>What is the difference between computer storage and memory?</h1><p>When it comes to understanding computer hardware, one of the most important distinctions to understand is the difference between storage and memory.  Storage is a general term that refers to any technology that allows data to be retained for future use. Memory, on the other hand, refers to an electronic component that can quickly read and write data.</p>
<p>One way to think about the difference between storage and memory is to imagine a bookshelf. The bookshelf is analogous to storage because it can store books for future use. However, if you want to read a book, you have to go and get it from the shelf. In contrast, if you have a copy of a book in your hands, you can easily read it. This is analogous to memory because it allows data to be accessed quickly.</p>
<p>In practice, there is some overlap between storage and memory. For example, RAM (random access memory) is a type of memory that also serves as temporary storage. However, it is important to understand the fundamental differences between these two concepts in order to truly understand computer hardware.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-floppy-disks-work"><a href="#How-do-floppy-disks-work" class="headerlink" title="How do floppy disks work?"></a>How do floppy disks work?</h1><p>Floppy disks were once a staple of computer storage, used for everything from loading the operating system on a PC to distributing software in retail packaging. But they’ve been largely replaced by USB flash drives and other modern storage methods. So what happened to the floppy disk, and how do they work?</p>
<p>Floppy disks get their name because they’re made up of a number of flexible plastic sheets that can be bent and folded up into a small square. This flexibility allows them to be squeezed into tight spaces inside a computer or device. Each sheet has two circular tracks on it, divided into sectors. These tracks correspond to the areas on the disk where data can be stored.</p>
<p>When you want to store data on a floppy disk, your computer writes it to one of the tracks in one of the sectors. The disk spins around as the data is being written, so that the head on the disk can read it back later. To read data back off a floppy disk, your computer simply spins it back around until the desired track and sector are underneath the head.</p>
<p>One downside of floppy disks is that they can only store a limited amount of data: typically around 1.44 MB per side. This isn’t enough for most modern applications, which is why they’ve fallen out of favor. But they’re still useful for older devices or applications that don’t need much storage space.</p>
<h1 id="How-do-hard-drives-work"><a href="#How-do-hard-drives-work" class="headerlink" title="How do hard drives work?"></a>How do hard drives work?</h1><p>A computer hard drive is a data storage device that uses magnetic disks to store digital data. hard drives come in a variety of shapes and sizes, but all have one or more spinning disks with data stored on them.</p>
<p>When the computer is turned on, the hard drive starts spinning and the read&#x2F;write head moves to the correct location on the disk. The read&#x2F;write head accesses the data by magnetizing tiny areas of the disk. These magnetized areas represent bits (binary digits) of information that can be either 1 or 0. By reading and writing these bits, the computer can store or retrieve data from the hard drive.</p>
<p>The speed of a hard drive is measured in rotations per minute, or rpm. The faster a hard drive spins, the faster it can access data. Most consumer-grade hard drives spin at between 5400 and 7200 rpm, while enterprise-grade drives can reach speeds of up to 15000 rpm.</p>
<p>Today’s hard drives are much larger than their predecessors. Consumer-grade drives can now store up to 8 TB of data, while enterprise-grade drives can store up to 24 TB. To increase capacity while still keeping costs low, many newer hard drives use multiple disks that are organized into “arrays”.</p>
<p>One challenge for hard drive manufacturers is to make sure that data remains accessible even if a disk fails. This is done by using a technology called RAID (Redundant Array of Independent Disks). RAID allows multiple disks to work together as one volume, so if one disk fails, the others can still be used to access data.</p>
<p>Despite their reliability, all hard drives eventually fail. When this happens, it’s important to have a backup plan in place so that your data isn’t lost forever.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-a-RAID-configuration"><a href="#What-is-a-RAID-configuration" class="headerlink" title="What is a RAID configuration?"></a>What is a RAID configuration?</h1><p>A RAID configuration is a group of hard drives that work together to improve the performance and reliability of your computer. By using multiple drives, you can create a mirror (duplication) or parity (error checking) between them, which helps to protect your data in the event of a drive failure. There are many different RAID configurations, but some of the most common ones are:</p>
<p>RAID 0: This configuration uses two or more drives to create a striped set. This means that data is written across all of the drives, improving performance. However, if one of the drives fails, then all of the data will be lost.</p>
<p>RAID 1: Also known as mirroring, RAID 1 uses two or more drives to create a duplicate set of data. This configuration provides redundancy and protects your data in the event of a drive failure.</p>
<p>RAID 5: This configuration uses three or more drives and creates a striped set with parity. This means that data is written across all of the drives, but also includes parity information so that data can be rebuilt if one of the drives fails.</p>
<h1 id="What-is-a-NAS-appliance"><a href="#What-is-a-NAS-appliance" class="headerlink" title="What is a NAS appliance?"></a>What is a NAS appliance?</h1><p>A NAS appliance is a self-contained storage device that connects to a network to provide file-sharing and storage services. It typically includes one or more hard drives, and may also include features such as an optical drive, printer sharing, and backup software.</p>
<p>NAS appliances are popular for homes and small businesses because they’re affordable, easy to set up, and require no technical expertise. They can be connected to a network using Ethernet cables or Wi-Fi, and can be accessed remotely using a smartphone or computer.</p>
<p>NAS appliances are available in both desktop and rackmount form factors. Desktop models are typically smaller and less expensive, while rackmount models offer more features and larger storage capacity.</p>
<h1 id="What-are-the-benefits-of-using-a-NAS-appliance"><a href="#What-are-the-benefits-of-using-a-NAS-appliance" class="headerlink" title="What are the benefits of using a NAS appliance?"></a>What are the benefits of using a NAS appliance?</h1><p>There are many benefits to using a NAS appliance, including:</p>
<p>Affordable: NAS appliances are typically much less expensive than traditional storage solutions such as SANs.</p>
