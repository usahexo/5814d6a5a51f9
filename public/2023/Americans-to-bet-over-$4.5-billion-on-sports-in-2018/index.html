        <h1 id="Americans-to-bet-over-4-5-billion-on-sports-in-2018"><a href="#Americans-to-bet-over-4-5-billion-on-sports-in-2018" class="headerlink" title="Americans to bet over $4.5 billion on sports in 2018"></a>Americans to bet over $4.5 billion on sports in 2018</h1><p>Americans will bet over $4.5 billion on sports in 2018, up from the $4.2 billion wagered in 2017. The amount of money bet on sports has been on the rise for years and is expected to continue to grow in the coming years.</p>
<p>Much of the increase in sports betting is due to the growth of illegal betting. The legalization of sports betting in a limited number of states has not had a significant impact on overall betting volume.</p>
<p>The rise in sports betting is also being driven by new technologies that are making it easier to place bets. Mobile devices and internet-based sportsbooks are making it easier for people to bet on games wherever they are.</p>
<p>Sports fans are also becoming more engaged with betting, thanks in part to the explosion of fantasy sports. Fantasy sports give fans a greater incentive to follow games closely and make informed bets.</p>
<p>The increased interest in sports betting is also having an impact on the way Americans view professional athletes. Athletes are now seen as potential sources of winning bets, which has led to a change in public opinion about some athletes.</p>
<h1 id="NBA-says-it-will-not-allow-gambling-on-its-games"><a href="#NBA-says-it-will-not-allow-gambling-on-its-games" class="headerlink" title="NBA says it will not allow gambling on its games"></a>NBA says it will not allow gambling on its games</h1><p>The NBA has announced that it will not allow gambling on its games, in a move that could help protect the integrity of the sport.</p>
<p>“We believe that this is the best decision for our league and our fans,” said NBA commissioner Adam Silver.</p>
<p>Gambling on sporting events has become increasingly popular in recent years, with many fans placing wagers on everything from who will win to how many points will be scored.</p>
<p>While some leagues have embraced gambling, others have been more hesitant, fearful that it could damage the integrity of their sport. The NBA is now the latest league to take a stand against gambling.</p>
<p>“The integrity of our game is of paramount importance to us,” Silver said. “We do not want to do anything that undermines that.”</p>
<p>Many experts believe that gambling can introduce corruption into sports, as unscrupulous individuals may attempt to fix games or manipulate the odds in order to make a profit.</p>
<p>By banning gambling on its games, the NBA is hoping to avoid any such issues and ensure that fans can enjoy its contests without any suspicion of foul play.</p>
<h1 id="The-NCAA-announces-rules-changes-for-legalized-gambling"><a href="#The-NCAA-announces-rules-changes-for-legalized-gambling" class="headerlink" title="The NCAA announces rules changes for legalized gambling"></a>The NCAA announces rules changes for legalized gambling</h1><p>The NCAA Board of Governors announced a series of rules changes on Thursday aimed at reducing the risk of legalized betting affecting college sports. The NCAA will prohibit championship games from being hosted in states where gambling is legal, adopt new policies governing athlete wagering and strengthen rules against providing inside information to gambling organizations. The board also called on state governments to pass laws prohibiting placing bets on college sports.</p>
<p>The move comes as many states are considering whether to legalize gambling, following a Supreme Court decision last year that opened the door for them to do so. Legislatures in at least seven states are currently considering bills that would legalize some form of sports betting, according to the National Council of State Legislatures.</p>
<p>“Our mission is always to protect our student-athletes and preserve the integrity of competition,” NCAA President Mark Emmert said in a statement. “These historic decisions will provide additional assurances that our games are fair and uncompromised. As we continue working with all our partners on these critical issues, we remain committed to protecting the best interests of our student-athletes.”</p>
<p>The NCAA had previously announced it was forming a working group to study the impact of legalized gambling on college sports. That group issued a report in January that recommended adopting a number of rules changes, including prohibiting athletes from betting on their own sport and prohibiting Championship events from being held in states where gambling is legal.</p>
<p>The board voted unanimously to approve all of the recommendations from that report on Thursday. In addition to barring championship games from being hosted in states with legal gambling, the new policies governing athlete wagering include:</p>
<p>— Athletes will be prohibited from betting on any college sport, either directly or through a third party.</p>
<p>— Coaches and other athletics staff will be prohibited from inviting or facilitating any type of wagering by an athlete or anyone else associated with the team.<br>Maintaining amateurism is one of the bedrock principles of collegiate athletics and we must do everything we can to ensure no appearance of impropriety exists around any part of our programs. -Mark Emmert, NCAA President<br>— Athletes and staff will be subject to disciplinary action for violations, which could include being banned from participating in future postseason events.<br>— Schools will be required to submit annual reports detailing any violations involving athletes or staff relating to wagering on college sports.</p>
<p>In addition, the board voted unanimously to adopt strengthened rules against providing inside information to gambling organizations aimed at deterring corruption in college sports.</p>

<p>But other league owners seem more open to legalizing sports betting. “I’m not opposed to it,” John Mara, the owner of the New York Giants, said at the NFL meetings on Monday. “I think there’s a lot of money to be made in it.”</p>
<p>Mara suggested that the league could Earn income by taking a cut of bets placed on NFL games. “We’re certainly going to look at it,” he said.</p>
<p>NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell was noncommittal about the issue, saying only that the league would continue to “monitor” it. He added that any change in policy would require a vote by the owners.</p>
<p>The NFL has been cautious about endorsing legalized sports betting in part because of its longstanding opposition to gambling. But many observers believe that the league is reevaluating its stance in light of recent court decisions that have cleared the way for legalized sports betting nationwide.</p>
<p>The NFL held its annual meetings this week, and one topic of conversation was how the league should respond to legalized sports betting. Tom Brady, quarterback for the New England Patriots, believes that the NFL should prohibit legalized sports betting, while other league owners seem more open to it. The NFL has been cautious about endorsing legalized sports betting in part because of its longstanding opposition to gambling, but many observers believe that the league is reevaluating its stance in light of recent court decisions that have cleared the way for legalized sports betting nationwide.</p>
<h1 id="MLB-commissioner-Rob-Manfred-talks-about-the-impact-of-legalized-gambling"><a href="#MLB-commissioner-Rob-Manfred-talks-about-the-impact-of-legalized-gambling" class="headerlink" title="MLB commissioner Rob Manfred talks about the impact of legalized gambling"></a>MLB commissioner Rob Manfred talks about the impact of legalized gambling</h1><p>Since the Supreme Court struck down the federal ban on sports betting in May, MLB commissioner Rob Manfred has been outspoken about his concerns over its impact on the sport.</p>
<p>“There is this new attraction to gambling, and we have to be honest with ourselves: Gambling can create a financial interest in manipulating the outcome of a game,” Manfred said at a news conference last month.</p>
<p>He reiterated those concerns in a recent interview with ESPN, saying that legalized gambling “creates a risk that our sport will be corrupted.”</p>
<p>Manfred’s concerns are not without merit. Las Vegas casino mogul Sheldon Adelson has already offered $25 million to any team that signs Japanese pitcher Shohei Otani, in an attempt to influence his decision where to sign.</p>
<p>While Manfred insists that he is not opposed to gambling per se, he is worried about its potential impact on the integrity of the game. “The essence of our product is the competition between teams,” he said. “And as long as there is betting on individual games, there is always the potential for somebody who has inside information to make an unfair bet.”</p>
<p>Legalized gambling could also have a negative effect on fan attendance and viewership. If people can wager on games legally, they may be less likely to attend or watch them in person or on television.</p>
<p>This could be a particular problem for MLB, which already has declining viewership numbers. In 2017, viewership for regular season MLB games was down 9 percent from the previous year.</p>
<p>Manfred is not opposed to expanding MLB’s presence in overseas markets like Asia and Europe, but he recognizes that gambling could present a major obstacle to those plans. “It’s always been difficult to bring legalized betting into new jurisdictions because it creates a real perception issue for us,” he said.</p>
<p>Despite these concerns, Manfred does not want to see the legalization of gambling nationwide. He believes that it should be up to each individual state to decide whether or not to legalize it.</p>
