The union claims that the clubs in question – the Boston Bruins, Chicago Blackhawks and Pittsburgh Penguins – are paying their baccarat dealers less than minimum wage.</p>
<p>In a statement released on Wednesday, the players’ union said that it had filed a complaint with the US Department of Labor on behalf of the dealers. It alleged that the dealers were being paid an hourly wage of just $5.25, well below the federal minimum wage of $7.25.</p>
<p>“It is unacceptable for employers in this country to shirk their responsibility to pay workers a living wage, especially when those workers are providing a service that is enjoyed by wealthy and privileged members of our society,” said Mathieu Schneider, special counsel to the NHLPA.</p>
<p>The union said that it was asking the Department of Labor to investigate the matter and enforce minimum wage laws. It also called on the NHL to ensure that its teams complied with labor standards.</p>
<p>A spokesperson for the Bruins told reporters that the team was “disappointed” by the players’ union’s statement and denied any wrongdoing. The Blackhawks and Penguins both declined to comment.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that labor issues have arisen in relation to casino games in professional sports leagues. In 2010, card dealers at casinos in Las Vegas associated with the National Football League Players Association went on strike over what they said were low wages and poor working conditions.</p>
<h1 id="Report-Shows-Ontario-Baccarat-Dealers-Earn-Average-Salary-of-23-x2F-Hour"><a href="#Report-Shows-Ontario-Baccarat-Dealers-Earn-Average-Salary-of-23-x2F-Hour" class="headerlink" title="Report Shows Ontario Baccarat Dealers Earn Average Salary of $23&#x2F;Hour"></a>Report Shows Ontario Baccarat Dealers Earn Average Salary of $23&#x2F;Hour</h1><p>Ontario’s casinos are a popular destination for tourists and locals alike. Not only are they a place to have some fun and potentially win some money, but they also offer jobs and career opportunities to thousands of people, including baccarat dealers.</p>
<p>The Commission de la protection du travail (CPT) recently released a report that shows the average salary of Ontario’s baccarat dealers is $23 per hour. This is good news for the dealers, as it confirms that their jobs offer competitive wages and good working conditions.</p>
<p>The CPT report also found that the majority of casino employees in Ontario are women, with nearly 60 percent of all employees being female. This is great news for women who are looking for good-paying jobs in a male-dominated industry.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the report also found that most casino employees work part-time. Nearly three-quarters of all casino employees work less than 35 hours per week, which means they can easily balance their work with other commitments.</p>
<p>So if you’re looking for a fun, exciting job in a friendly environment, consider becoming a baccarat dealer in an Ontario casino. The pay is good and the hours are flexible, making it the perfect job for anyone looking to make some extra money.</p>
<h1 id="Study-Shows-Baccarat-Dealers-in-Ontario-Make-More-Than-Most-NHL-Players"><a href="#Study-Shows-Baccarat-Dealers-in-Ontario-Make-More-Than-Most-NHL-Players" class="headerlink" title="Study Shows Baccarat Dealers in Ontario Make More Than Most NHL Players"></a>Study Shows Baccarat Dealers in Ontario Make More Than Most NHL Players</h1><p>According to a study released last week by the University of Waterloo, baccarat dealers in Ontario make more on average than most NHL players.</p>
<p>The study found that the average annual salary for a baccarat dealer in Ontario is $88,000, while the average annual salary for an NHL player is $75,000.</p>
<p>“The results of our study are surprising and raise a lot of questions,” said University of Waterloo professor John50740fd827 Paulson. “It’s unclear why baccarat dealers would be making more money than NHL players, given that the hockey industry is much more popular and generates much higher revenues.”</p>
<p>Paulson said the study also found that the salaries of baccarat dealers are growing faster than those of NHL players. In 2000, the average annual salary for a baccarat dealer was $52,000, while the average annual salary for an NHL player was $42,000. By 2016, the average annual salary for a baccarat dealer had grown to $88,000, while the average annual salary for an NHL player had grown to $75,000.</p>
<p>“The salaries of both baccarat dealers and NHL players have been growing over time, but the growth rate for baccarat dealers has been much higher,” Paulson said. “This suggests that baccarat dealers are in high demand and that their skills are in high demand.”</p>
<p>Paulson said the study also found that there is a very large pay gap between different types of baccarat dealers. In general, supervisors earn much more than regular dealers.</p>
<p>“Our data shows that there is a big discrepancy in pay between regular dealers and supervisors, with supervisors earning significantly more money than regular dealers,” Paulson said. “This suggests that supervisors are in high demand and have valuable skills that regular dealers don’t have.”</p>
<h1 id="Toronto-Casino-Workers-to-Get-15-Minimum-Wage-But-Baccarat-Dealers-Left-Out"><a href="#Toronto-Casino-Workers-to-Get-15-Minimum-Wage-But-Baccarat-Dealers-Left-Out" class="headerlink" title="Toronto Casino Workers to Get $15 Minimum Wage, But Baccarat Dealers Left Out"></a>Toronto Casino Workers to Get $15 Minimum Wage, But Baccarat Dealers Left Out</h1><p>The recent decision by the Ontario government to legislate a $15 minimum wage for all workers in the province, including those in the casino industry, has come as a relief to many.</p>
<p>However, not all casino employees will benefit equally from the wage hike. While dealers in games such as blackjack and roulette will see their hourly pay increase to $15, those who work in baccarat will only receive a raise to $13.</p>
<p>This discrepancy has been criticized by some as unfair and discriminatory. In light of this, some baccarat dealers have threatened to go on strike.</p>
<p>Labour activists argue that the government’s move amounts to little more than “tokenism”, since it does nothing to address the high levels of income inequality that exist in Ontario. They maintain that all casino employees should be paid a living wage of $15 an hour.</p>
<p>The government has responded by saying that it is committed to helping all workers in the province achieve a decent standard of living, but that it also needs to balance this with the need to maintain a competitive business environment.</p>
<h1 id="Ontario-Government-Announces-Plans-to-Raise-Minimum-Wage-for-Casino-Staff-Except-Baccarat-Dealers"><a href="#Ontario-Government-Announces-Plans-to-Raise-Minimum-Wage-for-Casino-Staff-Except-Baccarat-Dealers" class="headerlink" title="Ontario Government Announces Plans to Raise Minimum Wage for Casino Staff, Except Baccarat Dealers"></a>Ontario Government Announces Plans to Raise Minimum Wage for Casino Staff, Except Baccarat Dealers</h1><p>TORONTO, ON–(Marketwired - January 11, 2017) - The Ontario government has announced plans to raise the minimum wage for casino staff, with the exception of baccarat dealers.</p>
<p>As of January 15, 2017, the minimum wage for casino staff will increase from $11.60 per hour to $14.00 per hour. This increase will apply to all casino staff except baccarat dealers, who will continue to earn a minimum wage of $12.20 per hour.</p>
<p>“We are committed to ensuring that our casino employees receive a fair and equitable wage,” said Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne in a statement. “This increase will help ensure that all casino employees are able to provide for themselves and their families.”</p>
<p>The government says that the increase is part of its ongoing effort to protect workers and support the middle class.</p>
